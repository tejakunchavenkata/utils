       periodic
               Runs every tperiod minutes.  This provides a convenient means for checking on common but infrequent changes such as new  mail.
               For example, if one does

                   > set tperiod = 30
                   > alias periodic checknews

               then  the  checknews(1)  program runs every 30 minutes.  If periodic is set but tperiod is unset or set to 0, periodic behaves
               like precmd.

       precmd  Runs just before each prompt is printed.  For example, if one does

                   > alias precmd date

               then date(1) runs just before the shell prompts for each command.  There are no limits on what precmd can be set  to  do,  but
               discretion should be used.

       postcmd Runs before each command gets executed.

                   > alias postcmd  ’echo -n "^[]2\;\!#^G"’

               then executing vi foo.c will put the command string in the xterm title bar.

       color   If  set, it enables color display for the builtin ls-F and it passes --color=auto to ls.  Alternatively, it can be set to only
               ls-F or only ls to enable color to only one command.  Setting it to nothing is equivalent to setting it to (ls-F ls).

       colorcat
               If set, it enables color escape sequence for NLS message files.  And display colorful NLS messages.

       cdpath  A list of directories in which cd should search for subdirectories if they aren’t found in the current directory.
