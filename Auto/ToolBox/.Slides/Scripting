Scripting.... 

        Why Scripting...?

        Time is precious. It is non-sense-ical to waste time typing a frequently used sequence of commands at a command prompt, 
        more especially if they are abnormally long or complex. Scripting is a way by which one can alleviate this necessity by - 
        automating these command sequences in order to make ones life at the shell easier and more productive. Scripting is all -
        about making the computer, the tool, do the work.

Advantage :

        -- Reduces the work

        -- Avoids the redundant repeated work

        -- Reusable 

        -- Less possibility of error occurance
