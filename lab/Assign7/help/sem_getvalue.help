NAME
       sem_getvalue - get the value of a semaphore

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_getvalue(sem_t *sem, int *sval);

       Link with -lrt or -pthread.

DESCRIPTION
       sem_getvalue() places the current value of the semaphore pointed to sem into the integer pointed to by sval.

       If  one	or  more processes or threads are blocked waiting to lock the semaphore with sem_wait(3), POSIX.1-2001 permits two possibilities for the value returned in sval: either 0 is returned; or a negative number
       whose absolute value is the count of the number of processes and threads currently blocked in sem_wait(3).  Linux adopts the former behavior.

RETURN VALUE
       sem_getvalue() returns 0 on success; on error, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       EINVAL sem is not a valid semaphore.

CONFORMING TO
       POSIX.1-2001.

NOTES
       The value of the semaphore may already have changed by the time sem_getvalue() returns.

NAME
       sem_getvalue - get the value of a semaphore (REALTIME)

SYNOPSIS
       #include <semaphore.h>

       int sem_getvalue(sem_t *restrict sem, int *restrict sval);


DESCRIPTION
       The  sem_getvalue()  function  shall update the location referenced by the sval argument to have the value of the semaphore referenced by sem without affecting the state of the semaphore. The updated value repre‚Äê
       sents an actual semaphore value that occurred at some unspecified time during the call, but it need not be the actual value of the semaphore when it is returned to the calling process.

       If sem is locked, then the object to which sval points shall either be set to zero or to a negative number whose absolute value represents the number of processes waiting for the  semaphore  at  some	unspecified
       time during the call.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, the sem_getvalue() function shall return a value of zero. Otherwise, it shall return a value of -1 and set errno to indicate the error.

ERRORS
       The sem_getvalue() function shall fail if:

       EINVAL The sem argument does not refer to a valid semaphore.


       The following sections are informative.

EXAMPLES
       None.

APPLICATION USAGE
       The sem_getvalue() function is part of the Semaphores option and need not be available on all implementations.

RATIONALE
       None.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
       None.
